Hi,everyone. This is an assignment project I made for a company during our campus placements.
Gen-ai-travel-planner is a user-friendly Travel Itinerary Generator built with Streamlit and powered by Google's PaLM model. It allows users to plan personalized travel itineraries by entering their destination, trip duration, and activity preferences. The app generates customized itineraries, making trip planning simple and intuitive. Users can easily configure the app by installing dependencies and setting up an API key. With just a few clicks, users can create a detailed travel plan tailored to their interests and start exploring their next adventure.
